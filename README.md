# BRTA-Project
Modern and interactive web application that meets the basic requirements for an announcement management system. With a stylish layout, users enjoy a pleasant user experience where elements are arranged on the page to be easily accessible. The dimensions and colors can be customized according to individual preferences.

The app provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for advertisements, allowing users to interact with them seamlessly through the user interface (UI). To add a new advertisement, users can access an "Add" button that opens a dedicated form for entering advertisement details.

To view existing advertisements, users have access to a list of advertisements that can be filtered by category. This enables users to quickly find the advertisements that interest them.

For updating advertisements, each advertisement in the list is accompanied by an "Edit" button, which opens an editing form. Here, users can modify the advertisement details and save the changes.

Additionally, the app offers the ability to delete advertisements. Each advertisement in the list is accompanied by a "Delete" button, allowing users to remove the respective advertisement.

The app's components include a routing system, enabling users to navigate between different pages and functionalities of the application in a coherent and intuitive manner.

To ensure data integrity, the forms in the app are equipped with validations, ensuring that users provide correct and necessary information appropriately.

The UI application calls the methods of the backend application created in the previous lab, which provides support for the CRUD functionality. Validations are also implemented within the backend application to ensure that actions performed in the controllers are validated properly and that the data is correct and consistent.

For storing and accessing advertisement data, the app connects to a MongoDB database, offering a scalable and efficient environment for data management. Optionally, a custom database can be used based on the application's preferences and requirements.
